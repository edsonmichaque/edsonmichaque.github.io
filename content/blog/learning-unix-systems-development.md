Nowdays it's very hard to have a real UNIX Operating System at your hands, in fact I've never had one beside macOS,
but we have a lot of operating systems that resemble the UNIX interface, the most famous of that is Linux (GNU/Linux?),
apart from Linux we've a few BSD derivatives, namingly, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonflyBSD. In this series we are going to 
study the POSIX specification and write a few portable programs in consequence.

Systems programming is very hard, I've been trying to do it for a bunch of years, but my efforts are unsuccessful, maybe now it's time 
to switch my approach, I think I should try a different way.
